\chapter{Characterization of the Internet on Autonomous System Level}\label{chap:aslevel}

%intro and problem
The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.
The scalability of the Internet is achieved by topological addressing.
ISPs acquire transit providers to be connected to remote parts of the Internet or agree on peering relationships to exchange data without money flow.

The performance of content delivery highly depends on the available resources and the number of consumers.
The interaction of such applications with the network and other players, e.g. cloud providers, are usually not considered by the application developers.

In peer-to-peer networks

% overview
% in this chapter, ...
In this chapter, we characterize the number of resources available in autonomous systems for the two content delivery concepts, a) peer-to-peer networks and b) content delivery networks.
In peer-to-peer networks peers serve and request chunks of content at the same time, hence peers are also the resources for content delivery.
In content delivery networks the resources are content caches that run in data centers. To get content even closer to users caches can also be installed at the last mile or on customer premise equipment in home networks.

Due to the location based server assignment for content delivery a distributed measurement architecture is necessary to identify the server resources.
While peers can easily be identified by probing trackers, the cache resources of content delivery networks can only be determined by probing the content delivery network from different locations.
We compare the capabilities of a crowdsourcing platform and a PlanetLab testbed for distributed active measurements.
%In order to characterize the distribution of resources in content delivery networks, simple tracking is not possible, since no publicly available registers exist.

The potential of peer assisted content delivery approaches, such as \cite{HORST}, depends on the number of subscribers in the autonomous system.
To get a global view on the number of resources available in each autonomous system we evaluate the Internet Census Dataset, which contains a complete scan of the IP address range.

% details, figure
We identify the number of peers per swarm available in each autonomous system. We investigate the performance of different peer selection strategies. , as shown in \reffig{fig:aslevel:topo}.
% we consider + metrics
As key performance indicators we determine the traffic volume and the traffic costs of Internet service providers.
\begin{enumerate*}
\item user satisfaction, realized by a \gls{QoE} metric,
\item cost reduction in compute and network infrastructure.
\end{enumerate*}

% contribution
The contribution of this chapter is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item inter-domain
\item oppppppp
\item model IP distribution
