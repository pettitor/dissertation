\chapter{Characterization of the Content Delivery Networks on Autonomous System Level}\label{chap:aslevel}

%intro and problem
The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.
The scalability of the Internet is achieved by topological addressing.
ISPs acquire transit providers to be connected to remote parts of the Internet or agree on peering relationships to exchange data without money flow.
In 2015 61\% of all Internet video was carried by CDNs according to \cite{cisco}.
The vast amount of traffic causes high costs for ISPs, who need to provide the transport infrastructure necessary and pay transit fees incurred.
In order to develop traffic management mechanisms, aiming to reduce transit traffic and optimize content delivery, it is crucial to understand the current situation of content delivery networks and the number and distribution of available resources.
The performance of content delivery highly depends on the available resources and the number of consumers.

The interaction of such applications with the network and other players, e.g. cloud providers, are usually not considered by the application developers.

In peer-to-peer networks

% overview
% in this chapter, ...
In this chapter, we characterize the number of resources available in autonomous systems for the two content delivery concepts, a) peer-to-peer networks and b) content delivery networks and characterize the topology of autonomous systems.
In peer-to-peer networks peers serve and request chunks of content at the same time, hence peers are also the resources for content delivery.
In content delivery networks the resources are content caches that run in data centers. To get content even closer to users caches can also be installed at the last mile or on customer premise equipment in home networks.

Due to the location based server assignment for content delivery a distributed measurement architecture is necessary to identify the server resources.
While peers can easily be identified by probing trackers, the cache resources of content delivery networks can only be determined by probing the content delivery network from different locations.
We compare the capabilities of a crowdsourcing platform and a PlanetLab testbed for distributed active measurements.
%In order to characterize the distribution of resources in content delivery networks, simple tracking is not possible, since no publicly available registers exist.

The potential of peer assisted content delivery approaches, such as \cite{HORST}, depends on the number of subscribers in the autonomous system.
To get a global view on the number of resources available in each autonomous system we evaluate the Internet Census Dataset, which contains a complete scan of the IP address range.

% details, figure
We identify the number of peers per swarm available in each autonomous system. We investigate the performance of different peer selection strategies. , as shown in \reffig{fig:aslevel:topo}.
% we consider + metrics
As key performance indicators we determine
\begin{enumerate*}
\item the traffic volume and
\item the traffic costs
\end{enumerate*}
of Internet service providers.

% contribution
The contribution of this chapter is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We determine the potential for locality in peer-to-peer networks.
\item We develop and evaluate optimization strategies for peer selection.
\item We determine the distribution of content servers in a global CDN.
\item We provide a model for the distribution of IP-addresses on autonomous system.
\end{enumerate}
