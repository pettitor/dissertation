\chapter{Characterization of the Internet on Autonomous System Level}\label{chap:aslevel}

%intro and problem
The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.
The scalability of the Internet is achieved by topological adressing.
In this chapter 

The performance of content delivery highly depends on the available resources and the number of consumers.
The interaction of such applications with the network and other players, e.g. cloud providers, are usually not considered by the application developers.

% overview 
% in this chapter, ...
In this chapter, we characterize the number of resources available in autonomous systems for the two content delivery concepts, a) peer-to-peer networks and b) content delivery networks.
While peers can easily be identified by, e.g., by requesting trackers.
In order to characterize the distribution of resources in content delivery networks, simple tracking is not possible, since no publicly available registers exist.
Due to the location based server assignment for content delivery a distributed measurement architecture is necessary to identify the server resources.
We compare the capabilities of a crowdsourcing platform and a PlanetLab testbed for distributed active measurements.
To get a global view on the number of resources available we evaluate the Internet Census Dataset, which contains a complete scan of the IP address range.

% details, figure
We identify the number of peers per swarm available in each autonomus system. We investigate the performance of different peer selection strategies. , as shown in \reffig{fig:aslevel:topo}.
% we consider + metrics
As key performance indicators we determine the traffic volume and the traffic costs of Internet service providers.
\begin{enumerate*}
\item user satisfaction, realised by a \gls{QoE} metric,
\item cost reduction in compute and network infrastructure.
\end{enumerate*}

% contribution
The contribution of this chapter is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item inter-domain
\item oppppppp
\item model IP distribution
\end{enumerate}
