\section{Lessons Learned}\label{sec:cloud:lessons_learned}
In this chapter we examined tradeoffs between stakeholders in cloud environments.
As in the previously considered scenarios, various stakeholders exist, each with different and partially conflicting interests.
First, we considered

We draw three major conclusions from this chapter:

However, in all cases the \glspl{KPI} of the other stakeholders, by means of \gls{SLA} design, availability goals, or income, are also a \gls{KPI} for the platform operator.
This is due to the fact that not only one platform operator exists but multiple platform operators compete for customers.
Research on such multi-operator scenarios can be performed using the models introduced in this chapter.

Either push to NaDa, or provide interfaces to obtain popularity profiles.
Thus, we suggest to either provide interfaces tradeoffs, within reason, to the user.
