In
the 90s, the traffic in the web exploded, leading its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee to declare the
network congestion as one of the main challenges for the Internet of the future. The congestion
was caused by the
dotcom boom
and specifically due to the client-server model of connectivity,
whereby a webpage was downloaded from the same network server by every Internet user in the
world.  The  challenge  was  ultimately  resolved  by  the  invention  of  Content  Delivery  Networks
(CDNs),  and  the  exploitation  of  web  caching.  The  latter  replicates  popular  content  in  many
geographical areas and saves bandwidth by avoiding unnecessary multihop retransmissions. As
a byproduct, it also decreases access time (latency) by decreasing the distance between the two
communicating entities.
Today's Internet

One example of such a scenario are
This results in a clash of interests which negatively impacts the network performance for all participants.

The goal of this monograph is
To this end, we study
If such an optimisation is not possible or attempts at it might lead to adverse effects, we discuss the reasons.

In the remainder of this chapter we provide an overview over the scientific contributions of this monograph in \refsec{sec:introduction:scientific_contribution} and provides an outline of this monograph in \refsec{sec:introduction:outline}.

\section{Scientific Contribution}\label{sec:introduction:scientific_contribution}
This monograph studies the interactions between different stakeholders in three, partially overlapping, scenarios in order to provide an overview of today's interlocking network and application ecosystem.

In \reffig{fig:introduction:publications} we classify the areas of research as well as scientific methods used in relation to the chapters of this monograph.
The x-axis shows the impacted areas of research, i.e. topics related to the mobile network, the application domain or cloud technologies.
The y-axis details the applied scientific method.
In the theoretical area methods from queueing theory, mean value analysis and the analysis of random variables are used.
Measurements were performed using testbeds and custom software tools.
Simulation studies, performed using \gls{DES}, and created analysis tools are summarised in the practical area.

Annotations are used to highlight scientific publication whose content contributes to the respective chapters.
