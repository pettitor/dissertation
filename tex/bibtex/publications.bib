  Abstract                 = {The largest share of today`s consumer Internet traffic is video streaming and its demand on content delivery networks is continuously growing. To cope with the increasing demand of video streaming, recent work proposes mitigating end-user equipment to support content delivery at the edge of the network. The throughput of end-user equipment supporting content delivery is limited by the uplink of the users Internet connection.Especially for video streaming insufficient throughput causes the video to stall and affects the Quality of Experience (QoE) of end-users.To prevent video streams from stalling, we consider a tiered caching architecture, which requests higher tier caches to support content delivery, if the uplink throughput drops below a certain threshold. We conduct a simulative performance evaluation of the mechanism to investigate its impact on the QoE of end-users. Our results show that especially if the upload bandwidth of end-user equipment is low the setting of the threshold has a high impact. This can be used by operators to achieve the desired trade-off between QoE and operational cost for cache resources.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet serves as ubiquitous, prompt source of information in our society. Due to the giant amount of information, the access to the information relies on information processing mechanisms as implemented in search engines, product recommendation systems, or online social networks. As a result of the engineered preprocessing mechanism, the retrieved information is biased and does not represent a neutral view on the available information, while end-users often are not aware of this bias. In this article, we define the term “Information Neutrality”, review current principles of information processing in the Internet and discuss influence factors hindering Information Neutrality as well as appropriate countermeasures. The main contribution of this article is to raise the awareness of Information Neutrality as an emerging key challenge in the Internet and to potentially consider Information Neutrality as a factor in the value-sensitive design of Internet-based services.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet video constitutes more than half of all consumer traffic. Most of the video traffic is delivered by content delivery networks (CDNs). The huge amount of traffic from video CDNs poses problems to access providers. To understand and monitor the impact of video traffic on access networks and the topology of CDNs, distributed active measurements are needed. Recently used measurement platforms are mainly hosted in National Research and Education Networks (NRENs). However, the view of these platforms on the CDN is very limited, since the coverage of NRENs is low in developing countries. Furthermore campus networks do not reflect the characteristics of end user access networks. We propose to use crowdsourcing to increase the coverage of vantage points in distributed active network measurements. In this study, we compare measurements of a global CDN conducted in PlanetLab with measurements assigned to workers of a crowdsourcing platform. Therewith, the coverage of vantage points and the sampled part of the global video CDN are analyzed. Our results show that the capability of PlanetLab to measure global CDNs is rather low, since the vast majority of requests is directed to the US. By using the crowdsourcing platform we obtain a diverse set of vantage points that reveals more than twice as many autonomous systems deploying video servers.},

In this chapter, we argue that the availability of these data provides unique opportunities to monitor and analyse social structures and their impact on the success and performance of individuals, teams, communities and organisations. We further review methods from the planning, design and optimisation of telecommunication networks and discuss challenges arising when wanting to apply them to optimise the structure of enterprise social networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The load on cellular networks is constantly increasing. Especially video streaming applications, whose demands and requirements keep growing, put high loads on cellular networks. A solution to mitigate the cellular load in urban environments is offloading mobile connections to WiFi access points, which is followed by many providers recently. Because of the large number of mobile users and devices there is also a high potential to save energy by WiFi offloading. In this work, we develop a model to assess the energy consumption of mobile devices during video sessions. We evaluate the potential of WiFi offloading in an urban environment and the implications of offloading connections on energy consumption of mobile devices. Our results show that, although WiFi is more energy efficient than 3G and 4G for equal data rates, the energy consumption increases with the amount of connections offloaded to WiFi, due to poor data rates obtained for WiFi in the streets. This suggests further deployment of WiFi access points or WiFi sharing incentives to increase data rates for WiFi and energy efficiency of mobile access.},

  Abstract                 = {BitTorrent-based peer-to-peer networks constitute a significant share of Internet traffic. Therefore, the IETF working group on application layer traffic optimization (ALTO) discusses several approaches for guiding the BitTorrent traffic that aim at reducing the large amount of inter-ISP traffic costs caused by these networks. However, performance evaluations of these approaches are mostly limited to artificial scenarios that do not take into account the real Internet topology with its inter-ISP relationships and the actual distribution of BitTorrent users across autonomous systems (AS). In this study, we use measurements of the distribution of a large number of live BitTorrent networks and combine them with the AS-level Internet topology provided by Caida.org. Based on this data, we estimate in which tier of the Internet hierarchy BitTorrent traffic is mainly located and how much optimization potential exists for the different types of ISPs. Therewith, traffic flow and revenue implications of guiding Internet-wide BitTorrent swarms are analyzed. Our results show that tier-1 ISPs profit from the un-managed exchange of peer-to-peer traffic and that these profits significantly decrease when the other ISPs would apply ALTO solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Completing their initial phase of rapid growth, social networks are expected to reach a plateau from where on they are in a statistically stationary state. Such stationary conditions may have different dynamical properties. For example, if each message in a network is followed by a reply in opposite direction, the dynamics is locally balanced. Otherwise, if messages are ignored or forwarded to a different user, one may reach a stationary state with a directed flow of information. To distinguish between the two situations, we propose a quantity called entropy production that was introduced in statistical physics as a measure for non-vanishing probability currents in nonequilibrium stationary states. The proposed quantity closes a gap for characterizing online social networks. As major contribution, we show the relation and difference between entropy production and existing metrics. The comparison shows that computational intensive metrics like centrality can be approximated by entropy production for typical online social networks. To compute the entropy production from real-world measurements, the need for Bayesian inference and the limits of naïve estimates for those probability currents are shown. As further contribution, a general scheme is presented to measure the entropy production in small-world networks using Bayesian inference. The scheme is then applied for a specific example of the R mailing list.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile users' Quality-of-Experience (QoE) is degrading as network usage increases while Internet Service Providers (ISP) face increased inter-domain traffic. This paper presents a network traffic management mechanism, named RB-HORST, addressing these inefficiencies. RB-HORST exploits home routers by using them as caches and forming an overlay network between them to transfer content. To shift traffic from peak hours, RB-HORST employs predictions based on social network properties and based on similarity in the overlay network. To further improve user QoE, home routers allow trusted mobile devices to offload their mobile connection to the local WiFi. Simulation results show that an overlay is imperative for the success of the proposed caching mechanism. Especially ISPs with a large number of customers can benefit if only every thousandth user shares its router, reducing inter-domain traffic by half and superseding an ISP operated cache.

  Abstract                 = {Quality measurements are required to support VoIP traffic in the Internet. The widely used average Mean Opinion Score is, however, not sufficient for this task. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the Skype SILK codec and compare it with the iLBC and GSM codec. The results show that the SILK codec is superior to the other codecs in scenarios with random and bulk packet loss. This increased tolerance of packet loss enables the option of QoE Monitoring under reasonable network conditions. From analysis, we derive an estimation, which can be used to monitor the MOS value of the users in the worst case. Furthermore, we show how sampling can effectively decrease the required measurement effort.

  Abstract                 = {Today’s Internet services are increasingly accessed from mobile devices, thus being responsible for growing load in mobile networks. At the same time, more and more WiFi routers are deployed such that a dense coverage of WiFi is available. Results from different related works suggest that there is a high potential of reducing load on the mobile networks by offloading data to WiFi networks, thereby improving mobile users’ quality of experience (QoE) with Internet services. Additionally, the storage of the router could be used for content caching and delivery close to the end user, which is more energy efficient compared to classical content servers, and saves costs for network operators by reducing traffic between autonomous systems. Going one step beyond, we foresee that merging these approaches and augmenting them with social information from online social networks (OSNs) will result both in even less costs for network operators and increased QoE of end users. Therefore, we propose home router sharing based on trust (HORST) - a socially-aware traffic management solution which targets three popular use cases: data offloading to WiFi, content caching/prefetching, and content delivery.},

  Abstract                 = {The deduction of influence and trust between two individuals only from objective data in online social networks (OSNs) is a rather vague approach. Subjective assessments via surveys produce better results, but are harder to conduct considering the vast amount of friendships of OSN users. This work presents a framework for personalized surveys on relationships in OSNs, which follows a gamification approach. A Facebook game was developed, which was used to subjectively assess social influence and interpersonal trust based on models from psychology. The results show that it is possible to obtain subjective opinions and (limited) objective data about relationships with an OSN game. Also an implicit assessment of influence and trust with subcategory questions is feasible in this case.},

  Abstract                 = {To implement improved Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) management for content-heavy services like video streaming, content has to be moved closer to the edge. The concept of information-centric networking (ICN) would be a prospective enabler but is currently not practically feasible yet. We propose a hierarchical caching architecture utilizing caches on home routers to augment existing content delivery network (CDN) infrastructure. This approach can be implemented via Software-defined Networking (SDN) and brings current CDNs closer towards ICN. Based on a simulation study, we confirm that our approach is able to serve content more locally, which results in QoS and QoE benefits for end users as well as inter-domain traffic savings for network operators.},
