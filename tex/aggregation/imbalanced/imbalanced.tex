\section{Backhaul Bandwidth Aggregation in Imbalanced Load}\label{sec:aggregation:imbalanced}

To assess the full potential of the approach, we consider an inner and an outer composite system. Thus, we are able to apply the method to the case of heterogeneous load in \refsec{sec:aggregation:imbalanced:analytical_model}, which allows evaluating the gain in situations where an overloaded system can use spare bandwidth of underutilized links \refsec{sec:aggregation:imbalanced:numerical_examples}.
This further allows us to evaluate the fairness of the system and its robustness against free riders that try to exploit the system by receiving available bandwidth without contributing spare bandwidth to neighboring systems.
