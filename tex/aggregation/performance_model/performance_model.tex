%\section{A Performance Model for \glsentryshort{3G} \glsentryshort{RRC} States}\label{sec:aggregation:model}
\section{Potential of Backhaul Bandwidth Aggregation}\label{sec:aggregation:model}

In order to investigate the system dynamics of bandwidth aggregation systems with offloading policy, we develop analytical models.

In \refsec{sec:network:performance_model:analytical_model} we introduce a Markov model for two links. The Markov model is extended to be applicable for two and more links using a fixed point approximation, allowing us to reduce the n-dimensional Markov chain to evaluate the steady state probabilities efficiently.

The models are used in \refsec{sec:network:performance_model:analytical_model} to study the characteristics of bandwidth aggregation systems and to determine optimal threshold settings for the offloading policy.
